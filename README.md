# Stock Price Forecasting in an Inflationary market using Artificial Neural Networks


## Introduction
- For many business analysts and researchers, forecasting stock market prices has always been a difficult task. 
- We compare multiple methods of forecasting the price of a singular stock In this instance, we will be focusing on forecasting Googleâ€™s (ticker symbol GOOG) stock price. 
- Correlated stocks considered are Amazon, Apple and the S&P500 index (ticker symbols AMZN, AAPL, SPY respectively). 
- We use permutations and combinations of relative strength index, inflation data and closing prices of other related stocks as inputs. 

## Data
- Collected data from Yahoo Finance for various stocks from the day of listing for stocks of Google, Apple, Amazon and S&P 500 from 2004 to 2022.
- Identified Closing price as the parameter that represents the overall value of the stock.
- Scaled the data to the range -1 to 1 to provide as input to the model.
- Identified Apple, Amazon and S&P 500 as the correlated stocks based the overall movement over the years and duration of the stock being listed on the market.




Stock data for Google, Amazon, Apple and S&P500 are download in code from yfinance. However, RSI and Inflation data need to be imported which are provided in this folder.
